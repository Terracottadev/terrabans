<h1>Terrabans</h1>
<p><strong>An advanced global blacklist, modernized for the future.</strong></p>
<p>Protect your server from malicious players before they even make their way. Terrabans is a modernized global ban plugin, aiming at modernizing the way we punish players with malicious intent. We also allow ban syncronization between different bungee servers for non-global bans. Terrabans supports both spigot and bungeecord.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<h3>Global Blacklist</h3>
<p>On player join the UUID of a player will be grabbed and compared to a external database. If a match is found, the player wanting to join gets kicked with a specified message. If you find a malicious player you wish to get blacklisted you may report this player on the <a href="https://terrabans.org">Terrabans</a> website, which you can also visit to view a list of all players in the database.</p>
<h3>Local Bans</h3>
<p>Local banning works like any other ban plugin, except that there are some key differences which for example allow the use of databases for large multi-bungee networks and use of bungee to spigot and vise-versa protocols to only use a bungee plugin on bungeecord networks.</p>
