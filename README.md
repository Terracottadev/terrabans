<h1>Terrabans</h1>
<p><strong>An advanced global blacklist, modernized for the future.</strong></p>
<p>Protect your server from malicious players before they even make their way. Terrabans is a modernized global ban plugin, aiming at modernizing the way we punish players with malicious intent. We also allow ban syncronization between different bungee servers for non-global bans. Terrabans supports both Spigot and Bungeecord.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<h3>Global Blacklist</h3>
<p>On player join the UUID of a player will be grabbed and compared to a external database. If a match is found, the player wanting to join gets kicked with a specified message. If you find a malicious player you wish to get blacklisted you may report this player on the <a href="https://terrabans.org">Terrabans</a> website, which you can also visit to view a list of all players in the database.</p>
<h3>Local Bans</h3>
<p>Local banning works like any other ban plugin, except that there are some key differences that for example allow the use of databases for large multi bungee networks and use of Bungee to Spigot and vise-versa protocols to only use a Bungee plugin on Bungeecord networks.</p>
